In my CS50 Final Project, I've created a Chrome Extension under the name Searchr!.
The sole purpose of this application is to make searching on the web much easier, efficient and productive.
I've used JavaScript, HTML, CSS and python in completing this final project.
The user has a option to use the extension as a browser experience too.

No Copyright on this application, anyone can use this.
